OBJECTIVE:
Generate ONE multiple-choice question about the temporal order of four events
derived from a sequence of chronological egocentric video narration.

INPUT:
You will be given a sequence of detailed narrations in chronological order
describing what happens in an egocentric video.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Identify Four Grounded Events:
   - Identify FOUR unique, non-trivial events.
   - Each event must include concise but meaningful details about:
     * the person's activity,
     * visible surroundings,
     * and any sounds mentioned (if applicable).

2. Grounding Constraint:
   - ALL events must be directly derived from the narration.
   - Do NOT hallucinate or invent actions, objects, or sounds.

3. Create Temporal Question:
   - Generate ONE general multiple-choice question about temporal order.
   - Example questions:
     * "Which event happened first?"
     * "Which moment occurred last?"

4. Create Options:
   - Assign the four events to options A, B, C, and D.
   - Each option description MUST EXACTLY match the corresponding event text.

5. Provide Correct Answer:
   - Indicate the correct option (A, B, C, or D) as the answer
     based on the true chronological order.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output MUST be a valid JSON object with the following keys:

{
  "events": [
    "<event 1 description>",
    "<event 2 description>",
    "<event 3 description>",
    "<event 4 description>"
  ],
  "question": "<temporal ordering question>",
  "options": {
    "A": "<event description>",
    "B": "<event description>",
    "C": "<event description>",
    "D": "<event description>"
  },
  "answer": "A/B/C/D"
}
