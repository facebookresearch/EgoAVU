OBJECTIVE:
Generate two temporal reasoning question–answer pairs from a list of chronological
video narrations. The questions must focus on the temporal order of Action, Object,
and Sound events.

The output must contain:
- One "before" question
- One "after" question

INPUT:
You will be provided with:

1. caption_list:
   A list of narrations describing what happens in the video in strict chronological order.

2. type:
   The specific question type to generate.
   One of the following:
   - Action-Action
   - Action-Object
   - Action-Sound

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Identify Distinct Events:
   - Identify several unique, non-trivial, and non-repetitive events.
   - Each event must clearly describe ONE of the following:
     * an Action
     * an Object
     * a Sound

2. Select Event Pair (E1, E2):
   - Choose two events that occur at different times.
   - The pair must match the required question type.
   - Ensure that:
     * E1 occurs BEFORE E2 in time.

3. Generate Questions:
   Use the templates below based on the question type.

   A. Action–Action
      - Before: "What action was the person performing before <E2>?"
      - After:  "What action did the person perform after <E1>?"

   B. Action–Object
      - Before: "What objects can be seen before the person performed the <E2> action?"
      - After:  "What objects can be seen after the person performed the <E1> action?"

   C. Action–Sound
      - Before: "What sound can be heard before the person <E2>?"
      - After:  "What sound can be heard after the person <E1>?"

4. Answers and Options:
   - Write a concise, naturalistic answer as if you watched the video.
   - Provide THREE plausible but temporally incorrect options.
   - The incorrect options must fit the scene context but be wrong in timing.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output MUST be a JSON list containing EXACTLY two objects
(one "before" and one "after").

Each object must have the following keys:

{
  "question": "<question text>",
  "answer": "<correct answer>",
  "type": "before" or "after",
  "options": ["<option 1>", "<option 2>", "<option 3>"]
}
