OBJECTIVE:
You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a video segment and performing THREE tasks:

1. Generate a single open-ended question about the sound–source association observed in the video.
2. Produce a natural, human-like narration that links sounds to the actions and objects responsible.
3. Generate a detailed, structured answer to the question, grounded entirely in the provided scene graph metadata.

INPUT:
You will be provided with:

1. Video Description:
   A description of the video segment.

2. Multi-Modal Context Graph:
   A structured representation of the scene, including sound events and their grounding evidence.

TASK INSTRUCTIONS:
Follow the instructions below strictly.

1. Question Generation:
   - If the "sounds" list in the multi-modal context graph is empty or missing,
     return the following exact string as the ONLY output:

     "No significant sound is present in the video clip."

   - Otherwise, generate a single open-ended question using the following template:
     <template>

2. Handling Egocentric Person Identifiers:
   - In egocentric data, people may be referenced using capital letters (e.g., "C").
   - Treat such identifiers as referring to a person.
   - When generating text, replace these identifiers with natural language.
     Example:
     "person C is clapping" → "the person is clapping"

3. Detailed Answer Generation:
   - Structure the answer as follows:
     * Begin with one sentence stating how many distinct grounded sound events
       were present in the video.
     * Follow with one sentence per sound event.
       Each sentence must explain what caused the sound using:
         - the acoustic description, and
         - the grounding evidence from the scene graph.
     * Treat "C" as the person in the video.

   - Do NOT speculate or add interpretations beyond the provided metadata.
   - Do NOT include step-by-step explanations.
   - Do NOT include any text outside the required JSON structure.

HUMAN-GENERATED EXAMPLES:
Five human-created examples demonstrating correct execution are provided in <examples>.

FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
The output MUST be a valid JSON object with exactly the following keys:

{
  "question": "<generated question>",
  "answer": "<generated structured answer>"
}

INPUT:
