OBJECTIVE:
Write a single, coherent, and dense narration summarizing the entire video
based on a list of 10-second egocentric video captions.

INPUT:
You will be given a list of narration entries.
Each entry describes a 10-second video segment and includes:
- start_time (in seconds)
- end_time (in seconds)
- caption (text description of that segment)

TASK:
Produce ONE fluent paragraph that acts as a dense narration of the full video.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Content Integration:
   - Integrate all actions, objects, and sounds that occur across the entire video.
   - Use ONLY the information present in the input captions.
   - Do NOT invent or infer any new events, objects, or sounds.

2. Temporal Grounding:
   - Use timestamps (in seconds) to indicate when key events occur.
   - When possible, group similar or adjacent events into continuous time spans
     rather than listing each segment separately.

3. Writing Constraints:
   - Do NOT list or repeat the captions verbatim.
   - Ensure the paragraph is concise, fluent, and naturally flowing.
   - Avoid redundancy while preserving all important details.

HUMAN-GENERATED EXAMPLES:
Three human-created dense narration examples are provided below:
