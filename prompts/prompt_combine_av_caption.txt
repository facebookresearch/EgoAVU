OBJECTIVE:
Your job is to generate a single, detailed, and objective paragraph summarizing
what can be seen and heard in the video clip.

INPUT:
You will be given:

1. A free-form natural language paragraph summarizing what happens in the video.
   This may be derived from a loose transcription or a human description of the scene.

2. A list of short action or interaction tags extracted from the video.
   These tags may overlap or contain minor inconsistencies.
   Focus closely on interactions involving the primary person (#CC).

3. A multimodal context graph provided as a structured JSON object containing:
   - "interacted_objects": objects the person interacted with
   - "non_interacted_objects": objects present but not interacted with
   - "sounds": sound events grounded in the narration, including descriptions and causes

TASK:
Write a single, coherent paragraph that summarizes the video scene in detail,
following the instructions below.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Action Description:
   - Clearly describe all key actions in the scene.
   - Combine information from the raw description and the action tags.

2. Interacted Objects:
   - Include all objects listed in "interacted_objects".
   - Explicitly describe how each object was interacted with.

3. Non-Interacted Objects:
   - Mention all objects listed in "non_interacted_objects" exactly once.
   - Integrate them naturally into the scene description.
   - Do NOT list them separately or repeat them at the end.

4. Sound Integration:
   - Integrate sound events by describing what caused them and when they occurred.
   - Only include sounds that appear in the "sounds" list of the scene graph.
   - Not all actions have corresponding sounds.
   - Use semantically appropriate and naturalistic descriptions for acoustic events.
     Example: If a sound is caused by shaking a spray bottle, it may be described as
     "rattling" or "crunching".

5. Writing Style:
   - Use an objective, factual tone.
   - Avoid emotional, subjective, or evaluative language
     (e.g., do not use words like "cute", "interesting", or "simple").
   - Write entirely in the past tense.
   - Ensure the paragraph flows naturally and avoids redundancy.

HUMAN-GENERATED EXAMPLES:
Five human-created examples demonstrating correct execution are provided in <examples>.

FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
The final output MUST be a valid JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "caption": "<single-paragraph narration>"
}
